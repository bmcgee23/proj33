    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Bryant McGee. I'm a transfer student from Truman College and this is my 3rd semester here at IIT.
      Im currently enrolled in the ITM program and I plan on specializing in IT Entreprenurship and Management. Outside of school I co-operate a clothing boutique with my friend. It's a streetwear boutique based on the South Side of Chicago.
      I also have my own photography business where I photograph events, take portraits, etc. I love sports, learning about new tech, art,
      and anything creative. I want to use my ITM degree to connect connect small business with the larger global market, and I plan on implementing that with my own businesses.
