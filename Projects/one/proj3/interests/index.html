      <h2>Photography</h2>
        <p>
        I've been doing photography on and off since I was 12. My father taught me everything I know about the subject, but since ive been out of
        Highs school I've been doing photography more frequently. I've had my work featured on some blogging sites, and used
        for marketing campaings for small businesses.

      <h2>Entreprenurship</h2>
        <p>
        Since High School I've been working with my best friend on a clothing store venture. He's had the business for years,
        but 4 years ago he incorporated me into the fold. I help operate a clothing boutique based in Chicago, with locations in Atlanta.
        This incorporates multiple fields that interest me and it's something I want to keep doing in the immediate future
